   <p>Born on the planet Half-World, he found himself in a difficult environment. Life here began when humanoid creatures came here in search of a place for experiments. Half of the inhabitants of this world are robots, and the second are animals that are considered psychos. A mental hospital was built on the planet. The main goal of the experiments was to find out the reasons for the madness.</p>

   <p>The humanoids went home to replenish their resources and left the robots to watch what was happening. The planet was protected by a protective wall that did not allow aliens and exclude departures after the creators.
   Patients must be monitored. This task was entrusted to genetically modified animals, including Rocket. As a child, the hero was often subjected to tests and experiments, and then was forced to be in an unbearable environment surrounded by psychopaths. His name was the code 89P13.</p>

   <p>The rocket managed to escape from this planet. He traveled a lot across the galaxy, getting food from bandit hunting. Rocket became a mercenary and raided with Groot . His passion and grip can be attributed to madness, because when the hero is angry, one gets the feeling that he is uncontrollable.

   Rocket is a brave and fearless warrior whose skills any galactic traveler will envy. The offer to join the squad of defenders came to Rocket by accident. Star-Lord has offered to take a place among other aliens to protect the universe.</p>

   <p>The team was called upon to neutralize conflicts that provoke the appearance of space-time gaps. On one of the missions, space travelers rescued Captain Victory. From him, the heroes learned about the <b>"Guardians of the Galaxy"</b>, whose principles coincided with their beliefs. The friends adopted the new name of the detachment.</p>

   <p>Gradually they got to know each other better. The mystery of Star-Lord has been revealed. The heroes learned that he forcibly convinced them to create a squad and refused to cooperate. Rocket was among those who wanted to seal the alliance of the warriors. Thanks to Rocket Raccoon, the Mantis, Captain Victory, Gamora , Groot and Beetle were added to the team . Star-Lord and Drax have joined the new Guardians lineup. </p>

   <p>Few people know that the aggressive and unpredictable <em>Rocket is sentimental</em>. Have you heard of his girlfriend, Lily the otter?  Raccoon is in love with the heiress of the toy empire who remained on the humanoid's home planet.</p>

   <p>He has heightened senses, inherent in wild animals: sense of smell, the ability to see in the dark, the ability to distinguish objects without tactile contact. These skills have helped Rocket out in more than one theft. Rocket Raccoon is proud of his criminal biography and almost dances with delight, painting feats of arms. According to legend, the humanoid has 28 crimes and 23 courts for attempting to escape.

   Rocket's closest friend is Groot. Communicating through one phrase, he was the ward of a raccoon, capable of translating all the speech of a giant tree. The aliens got along well even before they met Star-Lord.</p>
